                  <p>
                    The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is &quot;the most dangerous government agency you&apos;ve never heard of&quot; &#8210; FERC:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Currently serves as a rubber stamp for natural gas infrastructure expansion</li>
                    <li>Operates a revolving door between industry, lobbyists, and regulators</li>
                    <li>Pushes the expansion of natural gas infrastructure</li>
                    <li>Engages in a corrupt &quot;fee for service&quot; relationship with energy corporations</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We need a Federal Renewable Energy Commission to be in charge of regulating our nation&apos;s electrical grid, prioritizing the growth of renewable energy, and making appropriate decisions accordingly about gas industry expansion and other non-renewable proposed projects. FREC would replace the 20th century fossil-fuel-industry dominated FERC and become a 21st century agency independent of the fossil fuel industry and committed to guiding and leading the rapid transition of the US energy system to renewable energy.

                               FERC has always been an independent government agency, and as such FERC commissioners and staff were expected to be politically neutral experts with past experience in energy grids and regulatory bodies. While we would dispute the claim that past commissioners were politically and energy source &ldquo;neutral,&rdquo; FERC was not seen as a political battle ground directly connected to the goals of the White House administration. As with many state agencies post-2016 election, Trump has ignored these precedents by nominating politicized figures as FERC commissioners. Joining FERC in 2017 Neil Chatterjee is leading the charge in the changing nature of FERC.</p>

                               Chatterjee was a policy advisor to Mitch McConnell from 2009 to 2017. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.energyandpolicy.org/neil-chatterjee-trumps-ferc-pick-rubber-stamp-fossil-fuel-utility-interests/">According to an Energy and Policy Institute article</a> Chatterjee lead the charge for the Keystone XL pipeline, undermined the US involvement in the Paris climate agreements, and moved to get states to reject the EPA&rsquo;s Clean Power Plan. He has presented before the Energy &amp; Environment Legal Institute, a coal funded climate denial group noted for attacks on climate scientists.

This has been seen by many as an attempt to gain momentum and sway from press coverage before commissioners meet and discuss proposals themselves. Notably the proposal Chatterjee presented to the press was a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/exclusive-chatterjee-details-interim-plan-to-save-coal-nuclear-plants/511044/">controversial plan to subsidize nuclear and coal fired power plants</a> unable to compete with newer natural gas power plants. Former FERC commissioners have accused Chatterjee of rushing the decision on this proposal as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/ex-gop-ferc-regulator-doe-nopr-a-tax-on-customers-to-benefit-murray-fir/509724/">a favor to the energy generator FirstEnergy</a>. FirstEnergy has close ties to Trump and donated to his 2016 presidential campaign. FirstEnergy made numerous comments on the proposal and met with Chatterjee in the weeks before he made his plans public to the press.

                                Chatterjee courted <a target="_blank" href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/trump-names-chatterjee-ferc-chair/540532/">further controversy</a> by bringing in Pugliese as the chief of staff at FERC. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/ferc-chief-of-staff-pugliese-steps-down/550943/">Pugliese resigned</a> after numerous public comments in support of far-right politics, slamming New York Democrats for their resistance to fracked gas infrastructure, and implying FERC and the White House administration were working together to create grid subsidy plans.

                                Lafleur was nominated to FERC in 2010 by Barack Obama. LaFleur is part of the old guard at FERC, which traditionally has been made up of long time electric grid agency officials. According to the <a href="https://www.troutmansandersenergyreport.com/2010/03/obama-nominates-cheryl-a-lafleur-for-commissioner-of-ferc-moeller-renominated/" target="_blank">Washington Energy Report</a>, LaFleur started out as an attorney within the New England Electrical System, and eventual became the CEO of National Grid&rsquo;s U.S. electric distribution business. While working at National Grid, she was part of the lobbying group &lsquo;Investors and Business for U.S. Climate Action&rsquo; which lobbied congress on carbon emission reductions. This past mixes a great deal of energy grid experience with an awareness of climate issues, but for many years this did not appear to impact LaFleur's voting record on fossil fuel infrastructure projects at FERC. Cheryl would push for there to be <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/lafleur-defies-ferc-majority-will-consider-broad-climate-impacts-of-pipeli/525729/" target="_blank"> assessments on greenhouse gas emissions</a> for each project, but eventually vote in favor of pipelines despite her concerns.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Richard Glick joining FERC in 2017 seems to have bolstered Lafleur&rsquo;s resolve in developing a harder stance on fossil fuel expansion. Lafleur sometimes joins Glick in making dissenting votes, but sporadically. She raises pressing questions about climate impact assessments, but ultimately does not stand in the way of expansion for the sake of efficiency. When Lafleur reluctantly approves projects to move the process along, commissioner Chatterjee uses these precedents as leverage to work Lafleur into further approval votes. Recently Lafleur voted to approve of the Calcasieu Path LNG export facility, leading to Chatterjee publicly expounding that &ldquo;<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/lafleur-chatterjee-pledge-no-prejudging-of-lng-exports-after-calcasieu-p/549030/" target="_blank">since we have agreement on what's been the thorniest part of the negotiation, that is why I'm optimistic that we now have a framework in place to consider these other applications and move them expeditiously.</a>&quot; Lafleur has balked at his claims, insisting that each project is evaluated individually. However the Driftwood and Port Arthur LNG projects are up for approval. We will see whether Lafleur stands by her principles. Lafleur&rsquo;s half hearted efforts to get climate issues addressed in the FERC process have the consequence of locking the US into natural gas infrastructure for decades to come. Half measures are not enough, but they have drawn enough negative attention to Lafleur that Chuck Schumer declined to to recommend her renomination to Trump. Lafleur&rsquo;s term will end in June, proving that even her limited resistance will not be tolerated in FERC.

                                Richard Glick was nominated and joined FERC in 2017. The Senate had lagged behind in filling quorum for FERC&rsquo;s commissioners, and Trump&rsquo;s nominees were being scrutinized. Richard Glick <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/trump-to-nominate-democratic-senate-aide-richard-glick-to-ferc/446151/" target="_blank">may be seen as a concession to Democrats in order to expedite the process</a>. Prior to FERC Glick worked as the Democratic General Counsel for the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. For many years Glick worked in the renewable energy industry, both in the private sector as well as as a lobbyist. Citing FERC&rsquo;s lack of climate impact assessments on gas infrastructure Glick has been a dissenting vote on each major pipeline project to be approved by FERC. <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/lafleur-defies-ferc-majority-will-consider-broad-climate-impacts-of-pipeli/525729/" target="_blank">Utility Dive reports</a> that Glick wrote that the approval process &quot;falls short&quot; of FERC's mandate to &quot;identify the consequences that our decisions will have for communities, individuals, and the environment&quot;...&quot;I cannot support issuing a certificate where the Commission has not made its best effort to consider a project&rsquo;s potential contribution to climate change.&quot; He regularly criticizes the lack of integrity of his fellow FERC commissioners on <a href="https://twitter.com/RichGlickFERC" target="_blank">his Twitter</a>.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 Glick is a welcome addition to FERC, as he pushes against the climate denial and pro-industry sentiments of the agency. However, one climate aware commissioner is not (and has not) been enough to fundamentally change FERC. There is little to no likelihood that there will be enough shift within presidential nominees, Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee votes, and full Senate votes that a majority of FERC commissioners would be pro-climate justice. Even if this was the case, as has been declared by Chatterjee himself &ldquo;<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/gas-rush-fercs-pipeline-approvals-underline-persisting-controversy-over-p/511746/" target="_blank">If an application is lawfully submitted and dutifully executed, we will evaluate it &mdash; and if the parameters are met under our statutes, we have to approve it...the reality is to change the process, there have to be statutory changes.</a>&rdquo; FERC doesn&rsquo;t have such a damning track record of approving pipelines (<a href="https://publicintegrity.org/2017/07/17/20982/natural-gas-building-boom-fuels-climate-worries-enrages-landowners" target="_blank">2 out of 400 have been rejected in 30 years</a>) because the &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; mix of commissioners were part of FERC. FERC is structurally designed to smooth out the fossil fuel approval process. It cannot be reformed from within, and must be replaced  by FREC, which can adequately address the large scale energy systems change we need to meet the challenges of climate change in a just manner.

                              <p>Bernard McNamee was nominated to FERC by Donald Trump in the fall of 2018. His nomination was widely contested by environmentalists and caused an unprecedented 50-49 split vote along party lines in the Senate. The Senate has not been split this drastically even on high profile votes such as Brett Kavanaugh. What caused such a deep split on something as mundane as a FERC nominee? Let&rsquo;s take a look at McNamee&rsquo;s track record to find out!</p>
                              <p>
                                McNamee is climate denier and a longtime promoter of fossil fuels. McNamee&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/11/10/1811919/-Senate-Don-t-Approve-Trump-s-Climate-Denying-Appointee-to-Manage-Our-Energy-Future" target="_blank">patchwork resume</a> includes being a lawyer defending utility and energy companies, Executive Director of the office of policy of the Department of Energy, energy advisor to Ted Cruz, and the conservative think tank Texas Public Policy Foundation (funded by Chevron and Exxon Mobile). He describes his work as the chief of staff for the Attorney General of Texas as <em>&ldquo;<a href="https://www.rtoinsider.com/ferc-trump-robert-powelson-bernard-mcnamee-100968/" target="_blank">challenging the federal government on environmental regulations, defending religious liberty and promoting federalism.</a>&rdquo;</em> His department at the Texas Public Policy Foundation&rsquo;s goal was to <em>&ldquo;<a href="https://files.texaspolicy.com/uploads/2018/08/16101046/2014-06-RR03-FossilFuelsTheMoralCase-KathleenWhite-ACEE.pdf" target="_blank">explain the forgotten moral case for fossil fuels.</a>&rdquo;</em>

                              <p>
                                In an <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/383605-this-earth-day-lets-accept-the-critical-role-that-fossil-fuel?fbclid=IwAR22ROOyAwo5wabflfF75XOS7nuBOWSkfdoW6nkXIG1FbNVNplVc3PGv2f8" target="_blank">Earth Day op-ed for The Hill newspaper</a>, he wrote &ldquo;America is blessed with an abundant supply of affordable natural gas, oil and coal. When we celebrate Earth Day, we should consider the facts, not the political narrative, and reflect about how the responsible use of America&rsquo;s abundant resources of natural gas, oil and coal have dramatically improved the human condition &mdash; and continue to do so.&rdquo;

                                As the head of the Department of Energy&rsquo;s Office of Policy, he worked on and then defended in a Senate hearing Rick Perry&rsquo;s proposal for FERC to <a href="https://www.rtoinsider.com/ferc-trump-robert-powelson-bernard-mcnamee-100968/" target="_blank">bail out the coal and nuclear industries at the expense of renewables</a>. In effect this proposal moved to subsidize failing nuclear and coal power <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trumps-coal-bailout-moves-to-the-back-burner" target="_blank">no longer able to compete on the market</a>. This plan was so obviously biased that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2018/10/04/the-energy-202-this-panel-rejected-trump-s-plan-to-save-coal-now-one-of-the-officials-involved-may-join-it/5bb520ef1b326b7c8a8d17f9/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2164181d7807" target="_blank">even FERC voted 5-0 to deny it</a>. After the unanimous rejection by FERC, <a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/sam-gomberg/trump-twists-the-law-to-bail-out-coal" target="_blank">McNamee has been hard at work looking for a legal, or extra-legal loophole to order that we pay some $34 billion in subsidies to failing coal and nuclear plants.</a>

                                Former FERC chief of staff, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060068833" target="_blank">Anthony Pugliese</a> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/breitbart/breitbart-news-sunday-anthony-pugliese-july-8-2018" target="_blank"> told a far-right Breitbart News podcast that FERC was working to approve McNamee's coal and nuclear bailout</a>, and repeated the statement to a nuclear energy conference. Pugliese's collusion is so extreme that <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/dems-question-ferc-over-chief-of-staff-role-in-coal-nuke-bailout/530799/" target="_blank"> even moderate Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee have said it &quot;call[s] into question the impartiality and independence of the Commission.&quot;</a>

                                McNamee&rsquo;s pretensions of energy &lsquo;neutrality&rsquo; collapsed entirely when <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/ferc-nominee-mcnamee-slams-renewables-green-groups-in-feb-video/542702/" target="_blank">Utilitydive released a leaked video of McNamee</a> giving a speech that included his pride over helping to crush Obama&rsquo;s climate plan. Statements such as &quot;understanding that fossil fuels are not something dirty, something we have to move and get away from, but understand that they are key to our prosperity, our way of life and also to a clean environment&quot; and &quot;the green movement is always talking about more government control because it's the constant battle between liberty and tyranny&quot; undercut Bernard&rsquo;s claims to be a fair arbiter on energy issues.

                                	Since joining FERC there have been numerous calls for McNamee to recuse himself from decisions related to his past lobbying, but has declined to do so thus far. Bernard McNamee represents Trump&rsquo;s influence shaping FERC, especially in regard to McNamee&rsquo;s old school favoritism to ailing industries like coal and nuclear.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    We are already experiencing some effects of climate change: the global temperature has been warmer than average <a hrer="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/all/4/1985-2019" target="_blank">each and every month since january 1985</a>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In that time we need <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/8/17948832/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report" target="_blank">to cut global greenhouse gas emissions worldwide by 45 percent</a>

                  <li>
                    Not meeting these targets will put an additional 10 million people at risk of displacement or death due to climate change

                <h3>FERC's Failures</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>FERC is supposed to be a regulatory and oversight body for energy infrastructure projects but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01jnjbGKMEQ" target="_blank">fails in this function</a></li>
                  <li>In the last 20 years FERC has only <a href="https://www.analysisgroup.com/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/ag_ferc_natural_gas_pipeline_certification.pdf" target="_blank">rejected two of the more than 400 gas pipeline proposals it has reviewed</a>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    FERC commissioners are <a href="https://www.desmogblog.com/2018/04/09/ferc-revolving-door-mcguirewoods-top-lawyer-perkins-fossil-fuel-lobbying-firm" target="_blank">generally drawn from the energy industry and lobbies and generally return after their tenure</a>
                </li>
                  <li>
                    FERC is perversely incentivised to approve pipeline projects because their funding comes from projects they approve due to the “fee for service” funding model

                <h3>Fracking and Natural Gas Myths</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Often times natural gas extraction and energy infrastructure are presented as climate friendly and in the public interest, but this is misleading
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In reality fracked gas is almost entirely methane, a greenhouse gas which is 86 times worse than carbon dioxide over a twenty year period, <a href="http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">according to the IPCC</a>. Methane leaks into the water supply at every stage of the fracking process, from extraction to transportation to end point use
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Over the last few few years, America has <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37172" target="_blank">shifted</a> from a net importer to a net exporter of Liquid Natural Gas
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    New energy projects are primarily designed to prepare and move LNG to the coasts for export to Asia
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In 2019 the US is expected to export <a herf="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37172" target="_blank">5.8 billion cubic feet</a> of LNG, <a herf="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIjYH5xc_1A&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">enough to power a trip to the moon and back 3242 times</a>. So Natural Gas extraction is not about American energy independence, and it’s certainly not climate friendly

                <h3>Green New Deal</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The Green New Deal is a proposal to transition American energy infrastructure to 100% renewable resources over the next 10 years as well as addressing economic inequality
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In January 2019 <a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/more-than-600-environmental-groups-just-backed-ocasio-c-1831640541" target="_blank">626 environmental organizations</a> signed a letter addressed to all members of congress supporting the Green New Deal
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    One study said <a href="http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/the-green-new-deal-has-strong-bipartisan-support/" target="_blank">81% of registered voters</a> were in favor of the legislation
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Replacing FERC is an important step for any Green New Deal program, because FERC has oversight over all energy infrastructure and is systematically biased towards extractive energy sources
